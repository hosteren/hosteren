Hi there! You can call me Trolle, and I am a web developer, digital artist, and a know-it-all nerd with a passion for creativity, technology, the brain, and how that will connect with AI. Here, you'll find a collection of projects that reflect my journey into the realms of code and imagination.

## About Me

- üåê As a web developer. If you ask me "What is the most fucked up thing you did for money?" I would easily answer "PHP". Python is my jam and jelly.
- üé® In the world of digital art, I explore the limitless possibilities of sophisticated brute forcing to create unique and visually stunning pieces.
  
## My Projects

Here's what you'll discover in my GitHub repository:

- [EMDR](https://github.com/hosteren/EMDR-for-browsers): Treat trauma from your browser.
- [LIX Calc](https://gist.github.com/hosteren/c0906cc0f8bc5187ec126d926e5d1870): Calculate the LIX (readability) value of a text.
- [Caesar](https://gist.github.com/hosteren/852202caffa5fa88b317689ff6ea5be8): A Caeser encryption tool. The gibberish detector is private for now, so no brute-force is available.
