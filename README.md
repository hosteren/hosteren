Hi there! I'm Trolle, a web developer and digital artist with a passion for creativity, technology, and the intersection of art and AI. Here, you'll find a collection of projects that reflect my journey into the realms of code and imagination.

## About Me

- üé® In the world of digital art, I explore the limitless possibilities of AI to create unique and visually stunning pieces.
- üìö I'm also an avid bookworm, and I share my book recommendations and artistic interpretations on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/trollekarlsson) and [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/trollek).
