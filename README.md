Hey, I'm Trolle, a web developer, digital artist, and AI enthusiast. When I'm not binge-watching every adult cartoon (almost all of them.. mostly), I'm busy exploring the latest tech trends and pushing the limits of what's possible.

## About Me
I'm a Python fanatic, a digital art dabbler, and a lover of all things AI. You can find me on GitHub and Hugging Face, where I share my projects and experiments.

## My Projects
- **Web Dev**: [EMDR](https://github.com/hosteren/EMDR-for-browsers)
- **Machine Learning**: [Caesar](https://gist.github.com/hosteren/852202caffa5fa88b317689ff6ea5be8)
- **Hugging Face**: I fine-tune small language models, including my pride and joy - [image prompt helpers](https://huggingface.co/trollek/ImagePromptHelper-danube3-500M) (think "a flower in a garden" becomes "a vibrant, pink flower with yellow petals in a lush, green garden") and Danoia [datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/trollek/Danoia-v03)/[models](https://huggingface.co/trollek/Llama-3.1-8B-Danoia) (teaching language models to speak Danish).
- **New Release**: [Voice2Input](https://github.com/hosteren/voice2input) - an app that uses Whisper to transcribe speech and paste it into the active window. Because, why type when you can talk?

I've spent the past year training LLMs non-stop on my trusty 16GB 4060 Ti. While my models might not be on par with the big boys, I'm stoked with the results. It's all about having fun and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

That's me in a nutshell - a tech-loving, AI-obsessed nerd with a passion for innovation and a soft spot for comedy.
